# Olympic-Azure-DE-Project

# Overview:
**Data Ingestion** — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources

**ETL System** — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format

**Data lake** — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them.

**Scalability** — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it.

**Cloud** — Microsoft Azure data cloud.
